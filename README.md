# Capture

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application `Capture (For Therapists)` for mobile devices that was created by Developer `Capture`. The Application is a one stop shop tool for mental health professionals to easily capture and timely retrieve case related details like Identifying Data, Case History, Case Attachments, Follow ups, etc.
 
## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

The application is an offline utility, i.e, it does not need a connection to the internet for it to be used. Any data captured by the therapist like identifying data, case history, follow ups, attachments, etc, are stored in the therapist's device. This data is never sent to any server. 

There is an optional feature in the application where in the therapist can backup all of the data to their _own_ google drive. If the therapist chooses to do so, then identifying data, case history, followups etc are encrypted and backed up to their google drive periodically. The encryption algorithm used is _AES-256_.

## User Provided Information 

The application does not have a registration screen. But it requires the therapist to connect with _their_ google drive **if** they choose to back up their data.

## Automatically collected information

The application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application. 

 
## Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Application and our service.

## Security

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of the information that is stored in the app. To address this we never send the data stored in the app outside the therapist's device. If the therapist chooses to back up the data to _their_ google drive, we store it in google drive only after encrypting the data using _AES-256_ algorithm. Please be aware that, although we endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
